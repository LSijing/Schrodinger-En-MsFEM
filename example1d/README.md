Multiscale FEMs for Schrodinger equations with time-dependent potentials

## generating 1d solutions and visualization
Run the script `schrodinger_ex1_1d_finesolution.m` for computing and saving fine solutions. <br>
Run the script `schrodinger_ex1_1d_coarsesolution.m` for coarse solutions (FEM, MsFEM, En-MsFEM). <br>
Use codes in `Figure_generator_ex1_coarse.m` to load saved data and plot figures. <br>
Change problem and discretization settings to run different examples.
