Multiscale FEMs for Schrodinger equations with time-dependent potentials

## generating 2d solutions and visualization
* Run the script `schrodinger_2d_ex4gpu_coarseEnMsFEM.m` for computing and saving Enriched-MsFEM solutions. <br>
* Run the script `schrodinger_2d_ex4gpu_coarseFEMMs.m` for computing and saving standard FEM and MsFEM solutions.
    * Delete gpu commands if gpu isn't supported (extremely slow if not use gpu ). <br>
* After obtaining solutions, use codes needed in `Figure_generator_ex4_coarse.m` to load data and plot figures. <br>
